This project is *supposed* to analyze a sound file selected by the user, meaning that it should have:
  - calculated the RT60 values for low, medium, and high frequencies;
  - displayed a waveform graph of the file;
  - combined all 3 of the RT60 graphs into one; and
  - show a specgram graph to represent the data of the sound file in some way,
but all we could get it to do is shown below.

When FinalProject.py is run, it opens a GUI with two buttons and 6 graphs of garbage data. These buttons are as follows:
  "Open File" - Click this first. When clicked, opens a file selection popup that prompts the user to open an audio file. When an audio file is selected, the popup closes and a second popup appears, showing the file path.
  "Analyze" - Click this after going through the above process. When clicked, does nothing; we could not get this to work.
